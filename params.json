Also interested in design and implementation of new reactors, including Small Modular Reactors\r\n\r\n# Education\r\n### University of Illinois\r\nBachelor of Science May 2017  \r\nNuclear, Plasma, and Radiological Engineering  \r\n  \r\nConcentration in Power, Safety, & the Environment  \r\nMinor in Atmospheric Sciences\r\n\r\n# Internships\r\n## Idaho National Lab\r\n### Fuels Modeling & Simulation Intern\r\nMay 2016-August 2016  \r\n* Experience running simulations using the BISON fuel performance code.\r\n* Validated the code with Pellet Clad Mechanical Interaction (PCMI) data from the Halden Research Reactor. \r\n* Took a short course on C++ and a short course in Neutron Transport Theory  \r\n  \r\n## Exelon Generation\r\n### Reactor Engineering Intern \r\nJune 2015-August 2015  \r\n* Developed communication tools to convey Reactivity Management (RM) concepts to 700+ plant employees. Tools included a quarterly newsletter, RM system of the week, and RM awareness posters around the site.\r\n* Verified Special Nuclear Material Inventory and bundle orientations for all spent fuel (and radioactive sources) at the site.  \r\n  \r\n### Spent Fuel & Decommissioning Intern\r\nJune 2015-August 2015  \r\n* Created a database which houses information about all fuel that has failed within the entire lifetime of Exelon's 23 nuclear reactors.  \r\n* Aided Exelon employees in various projects including accumulating data on cycle burnups for 4 of Exelon's reactors, and verifying fuel moves at the Zion reactor, which is currently being decommissioned.  \r\n  \r\n## Fermilab\r\n### Optical Astronomy Intern\r\nJune 2015-August 2015  \r\n* Analyzed blue tip stars vs. galactic longitude with a focus on galactoseismology, ultimately finding a north-south asymmetry in color.\r\n* Educated 30 high school science teachers about cosmic rays and cosmic ray detectors so they could bring those concepts back to their classrooms.  \r\n  \r\n# Research\r\n## Advanced Reactors and Fuel Cycle Research Group  \r\nAug. 2016 - PRESENT\r\n* Introductory experience in running CYCLUS fuel cycle code  \r\n\r\n## Analysis of Reactor Transients and Stability Research Group\r\nJan. 2016 - PRESENT\r\n* Gained introductory experience in running the BISON fuel performance code\r\n* Continued development of BISON cases benchmarking pellet cladding mechanical interactions\r\n\r\n## Experimental Thermal Hydraulics Research Group\r\nAug. 2015 - Dec. 2015\r\n* Developed a Computer-Aided-Design (CAD) 3D model of a section of lab space with over 30 pipes and supports for use in developing laboratory experiments\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n * radioactivekate@gmail.com  \r\n  \r\n## [Check out my full CV here](https://github.com/nuclearkatie/CV)\r\n",
